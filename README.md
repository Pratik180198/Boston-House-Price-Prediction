the expectations, however in some cases it will be correct or wrong along these lines, it makes 
an enormous issue for the organization, their mistake rates increments, so for this issue there is 
an answer by utilizing Machine Learning models to build their benefits.

We need to examine 
the information appropriately, understanding the highlights and afterward carrying out different 
models on it and choosing the best one for the task which will give us precise cost for the houses 
in that specific zone. It will help the land organization to acquire benefits by utilizing this House
